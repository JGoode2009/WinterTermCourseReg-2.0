Still working on creating links and most essentially how do I get it to take data from forms and to return them.
Had an issue with post vs get, and maybe also url form
      notes for 11/16

  It looks like the url_for part is the part that is causing the internal server error.
....yup it worked after i deleted url for and just inserted the page name...(lmfao, well I guess you just gotta try stuff sometimes)

now need to figure out how to link login to welcome page.

11/17
cooking with gas! Welcome page linked to name_entrance linked to course list.
Next steps, make course list some sort of list where user can order from fave to lfave, that can be saved (CRUD)
Add CSS style sheet, set a base html parent
Future steps
  make an attractive input grid
  maybe change from login with known password have students pick own password first
  Counselor side
    make a counter that lets counselors know how many in each class and lets put in each class
